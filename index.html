                Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal
                education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims
                and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is
                compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten,
                primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or alternative to formal
                education.It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner,
                and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly,
                informal education occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on
                the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional.
                In practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal
                learning can occur in all three settings.

                Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or
                fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
                rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order
                to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
                improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly
                different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the
                mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of
                cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new
                ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex
                vocational skills.

                There is disagreement in the academic literature on whether education is an evaluative concept.
                So-called thick definitions affirm this, for example, by holding that an improvement of the learner is a
                necessary requirement of education. However, different thick definitions may still disagree among
                themselves on what constitutes such an improvement. Thin definitions, on the other hand, try to give a
                value-neutral account of education.[17][19] A closely related distinction is that between descriptive
                and prescriptive conceptions. Descriptive conceptions aim to describe how the term is actually used by
                regular speakers while prescriptive conceptions try to express what good education is or how it should
                be done.

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Many thick and prescriptive conceptions base their account on the aims of education, i.e. regarding the
                goals that the activity of education tries to achieve. These aims are sometimes categorized
                into epistemic goods,
